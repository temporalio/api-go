### Protogen

We put in a lot of work to post-process the protobuf-generated files to meet our needs. This tool amalgamates all of that so we don't need to keep our various makefiles in sync.

This includes:
- rewriting generated `String()` methods for enums to be compatible with our old protos
- rewriting generated enums constants to remove the typename prefix that google/protobuf adds

### protoc-gen-go-helpers

This tool generates various helper methods required for compatibility with Gogo/protobuf.

For structs we generate implementations of:
- `Marshal()`
- `Unmarshal()`
- `Equal()`
- `Size()`

For enumerated types we generate a `FromString` method that instantiates the enum from either the old `PascalCase` string we have always supported or the `SCREAMING_SNAKE` string generated by protojson.
